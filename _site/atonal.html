<h1>Analyzing atonal music</h1>

<p>Following are a few tips, terms, and common structures that will be helpful for analyzing early twentieth-century atonal music, such as that composed by members of the Second Viennese School (Schönberg, Berg, Webern).</p>

<h2>Intervals</h2>

<p>Always use <em>chromatic intervals</em> rather than diatonic intervals when analyzing and comparing pitch materials. (See <a href="Intervals.html">Intervals and dyads</a> resource.)</p>

<h2>The 12-pitch-class cycle — clock face</h2>

<p>Atonal composers often begin with highly organized set of pitch classes, and then deploy the pitch classes in a wide variety of registers. Thus, it is helpful to eliminate register as a factor in order to find which motives, chords, and fragments belong in the same category. To do so, take a clock face with the twelve pitch-classes (spelling does not matter)</p>

<p>and mark all the pitch classes involved in the fragment. For example, here is a C-major scale:</p>

<p>This will make it easy to find the interval patterns in a set of pitch classes, no matter how they are distributed in the various registers and instruments on the score.</p>

<h2>Common pitch-class collections</h2>

<p><em>graphics and more details coming soon</em></p>

<p><strong>Diatonic</strong> – The usual major and <em>natural</em>-minor collections (white key collection and all of its transpositions).</p>

<p><strong>Pentatonic</strong> – The black key collection and all of its transpositions, prime form: (02479).</p>

<p><strong>Octatonic</strong> – An eight-pitch-class scale that alternates i1 and i2 (semitones and whole-tones).</p>

<p><strong>Hexatonic</strong> – A six-pitch-class scale that alternates i1 and i3 (semitones and minor thirds/augmented seconds).</p>

<p><strong>X-cell</strong> – The chromatic tetrachord, or a four-pitch-class chromatic cluster, prime form: (0123).</p>

<p><strong>Y-cell</strong> – The whole-tone tetrachord, or a four-pitch-class whole-tone cluster, prime form: (0246). It is a subset of the whole-tone scale.</p>

<p><strong>Z-cell</strong> – A four-pitch-class collection that alternates i1 and i5 (semitones and perfect fourths), prime form: (0167). Two Z-cells a minor third apart form an octatonic scale.</p>

<p><strong>French-sixth</strong> – The usual french-augmented-sixth-chord collection, but stripped of its tonal function, prime form: (0268). It is a subset of the whole-tone collection.</p>

<p><strong>Whole-tone scale</strong> – A six-pitch-class scale made up of successive whole tones, prime form: (02468T).</p>

<p><strong>Acoustic scale</strong> – A seven-pitch-class scale that resembles the major scale, but with <em>fa</em> raised to <em>fi</em> and <em>ti</em> lowered to <em>te</em>, in order to match the seventh and eleventh partials of the natural harmonic series.</p>

<p><strong>Dual-diatonic</strong> – An eight-pitch-class scale formed by the union of two diatonic collections separated by fifth—for example C major and G major: C – D – E – F – F# – G – A – B. It contains two diatonic scales, two Z-cells, and two Y-cells. It was used primarily by Bartók.</p>

<h2>Common <em>operations</em></h2>

<p><strong>Transposition</strong> – Moving every pitch (class) in a collection up or down by a specified interval. Transposition corresponds to <em>rotation</em> of a collection of pitch classes around a clock face.</p>

<p><strong>Inversion</strong></p>
