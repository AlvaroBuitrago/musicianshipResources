title: Analyzing atonal music

{{ page.title }}
================

Following are a few tips, terms, and common structures that will be helpful for analyzing early twentieth-century atonal music, such as that composed by members of the Second Viennese School (Schönberg, Berg, Webern).

## Intervals ##

Always use *chromatic intervals* rather than diatonic intervals when analyzing and comparing pitch materials. (See [Intervals and dyads][intervals] resource.)

## The 12-pitch-class cycle — clock face ##

Atonal composers often begin with highly organized set of pitch classes, and then deploy the pitch classes in a wide variety of registers. Thus, it is helpful to eliminate register as a factor in order to find which motives, chords, and fragments belong in the same category. To do so, take a clock face with the twelve pitch-classes (spelling does not matter)

and mark all the pitch classes involved in the fragment. For example, here is a C-major scale:

This will make it easy to find the interval patterns in a set of pitch classes, no matter how they are distributed in the various registers and instruments on the score.

## Common pitch-class collections ##

*graphics and more details coming soon*

**Diatonic** – The usual major and *natural*-minor collections (white key collection and all of its transpositions).

**Pentatonic** – The black key collection and all of its transpositions, prime form: (02479).

**Octatonic** – An eight-pitch-class scale that alternates i1 and i2 (semitones and whole-tones).

**Hexatonic** – A six-pitch-class scale that alternates i1 and i3 (semitones and minor thirds/augmented seconds).

**X-cell** – The chromatic tetrachord, or a four-pitch-class chromatic cluster, prime form: (0123).

![][xCell]

**Y-cell** – The whole-tone tetrachord, or a four-pitch-class whole-tone cluster, prime form: (0246). It is a subset of the whole-tone scale.

![][yCell]

**Z-cell** – A four-pitch-class collection that alternates i1 and i5 (semitones and perfect fourths), prime form: (0167). Two Z-cells a minor third apart form an octatonic scale.

**French-sixth** – The usual french-augmented-sixth-chord collection, but stripped of its tonal function, prime form: (0268). It is a subset of the whole-tone collection.

**Whole-tone scale** – A six-pitch-class scale made up of successive whole tones, prime form: (02468T).

**Acoustic scale** – A seven-pitch-class scale that resembles the major scale, but with *fa* raised to *fi* and *ti* lowered to *te*, in order to match the seventh and eleventh partials of the natural harmonic series.

**Dual-diatonic** – An eight-pitch-class scale formed by the union of two diatonic collections separated by fifth—for example C major and G major: C – D – E – F – F# – G – A – B. It contains two diatonic scales, two Z-cells, and two Y-cells. It was used primarily by Bartók.

## Common *operations* ##

**Transposition** – Moving every pitch (class) in a collection up or down by a specified interval. Transposition corresponds to *rotation* of a collection of pitch classes around a clock face.
